> normalize-url plus additional features to supercharge link normalization!

While `normalize-url` is good enough for many normalization use cases, this library is akin to prettier or black in that it ABSOLUTELY normalizes links, including features like default www-stripping and default https (both of which fall back should such links do not exist - unlike `normalize-url`), stripping ALL trackers (courtesy of clearURLs), following redirects (even those that can't normally be automatically redirected without manual user intervention such as youtube redirect links), and even extracting canonical URLs.
