The file `data.minify.json` is the "reference" version of the filter list provided by ClearURLs: https://rules2.clearurls.xyz/data.minify.json.

This mostly exists to serve as a "local" copy in case the HTTP call to fetch the latest version fails (because of course anything web is bound to break sooner or later) so you can still normalize URLs (or in this case, strip trackers off of URLs, you're welcome)!
